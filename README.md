# Just Another Math Library
A library with some miscellaneous math things. The first thing this library will handle is basic currency math (precise to two decimal points).

## Number Types
  - `Currency()` - A class that represents currency. Currency expects to be initialized with an integer representing the smallest dividable unit of currency.
  - `GOLDEN_RATIO` - A constant that represents the golden ratio.

## Currency Methods
  - `add(n)` - Add a Currency number and `n`
  - `subtract(n)` - Subtract `n` from a Currency number and
  - `multiply(n)` - Multiply a Currency number and `n`
  - `divide(n)` - Divide a Currency number by `n`
  - `split(n)` - Split a Currency number into `n` ways
